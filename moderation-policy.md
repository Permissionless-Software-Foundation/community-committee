# Moderation Policy

The PSF moderation policy is adapted from the [Node.js Moderation Policy](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/Moderation-Policy.md).

## Applicability
By default, this policy applies to all repositories under the PSF GitHub Organization and all PSF Working Groups. This policy also applies to the Node.js Telegram Community, supported by the Admin team of the PSF.

Individual Working Groups may adopt an alternative Moderation Policy for any repository under their stewardship so long as the Moderation Policy is openly documented as part of the Working Group charter and includes provisions for clearly and openly documenting Moderation actions taken.

If a particular repository can be considered to fall under the stewardship of multiple Working Groups that have adopted different Moderation Policies, they can choose to either:

- Decide among themselves which Moderation Policy will be in effect for the repository in question, or
- Ask the TSC to determine which Moderation Policy should apply.

Any alternative Moderation Policy used for a given repository must be included in the root directory of the repository using the `moderation-policy.md` filename. If a repository does not contain a `moderation-policy.md` file, then this default policy applies.

## Grounds for Moderation

Any Post considered to be in violation of the PSF [Code of Conduct][] is
subject to Moderation.

The Moderation Team is responsible for deciding what constitutes inappropriate
behavior that may be subject to Moderation.

## Requesting Moderation

Anyone may request Moderation of a Post. Requesting Moderation of a Post can be
accomplished by making a request on [the PSF Telegram channel](https://t.me/permissionless_software).

## Consideration of Intent

Before Moderating a Post, Collaborators should carefully consider the possible
intent of the author. It may be that the author has simply made an error or is
not yet familiar with the [Code of Conduct][]; or it may be that cultural
differences exist, or that the author is unaware that certain content is
considered inappropriate. In such cases, the author should be given an
opportunity to correct any error that may have been made.

Note, however, that unfamiliarity with the [Code of Conduct][] does not excuse
a Post from Moderation.

## Modifications to This Policy

Modifications to this policy are subject to approval by both the TSC and
CommComm. When modifications are proposed, if there are no objections after
72 hours, the modification are considered accepted. If there any objections to
any proposed change, a simple majority vote of each of the CommComm and TSC
in *favor* of the change is required.
