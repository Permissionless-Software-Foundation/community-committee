# Community Committee

The Community Committee is a top-level committee in the [Permissionless Software Foundation](https://PSFoundation.cash), focused on community-facing efforts. For current objectives, read [our OKRs](./okr.md).

The model for this committee is inspired by this article on [Healthy Open Source](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/healthy-open-source-967fa8be7951) and is adapted from the [Node.js CommComm](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee).

For more details read the [PSF Community Committee Charter](./community-committee-charter.md).

## Why does the Community Committee exist?

This Community Committee reflects a formal role and the representation of the 'voice' of the PSF community. The formation of this group as a committee alongside the [Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/TSC) (TSC) demonstrates that community-focused contributions are valued by the PSF, and that roles other than those of code contributor help foster a healthy, sustainable open source community.

The Community Committee works to empower people in every part of the project. By focusing on outward-facing community efforts, we aim to make the PSF more diverse and improve the environment for inclusivity, attracting a wider range of views, voices, and opinions, which in turn helps us ship better software.

Community Committee initiatives are formed with the intent of improving the cultural development and outreach within the PSF, and are therefore suited to engaging people with non-coding skill sets to contribute as well.

## Contributing
> code commits !== the only means to contributions.

The Community Committee is tasked with growing and sustaining the PSF Community. If you own even one PSF token, you're already a part of that community and we'd love to have your help!

Before you get started, here's a broad outline of the Community Committee's governance structure:

- **Community Committee:** meta-level admin concerns, cross-cutting with other groups like the [TSC](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/TSC) and Working Groups.
  - **Initiatives:** focused on specific tasks, independent from the Community Committee but sharing what they're doing in the Community Committee's [bi-weekly meetings][https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/community-committee/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%22PSF+Community+Committee+Meeting%22].

Most of the community work that immediately affects the PSF is done within the numerous **initiatives**. We recommend checking the [list of initiatives](#strategic-initiatives) below and getting involved with one that you find interesting! If nothing is particularly interesting to you and you have concrete ideas, [open an issue](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/community-committee/issues/new) here! We can help to point you in the right direction.

To **get started** with contributing, you should read the [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) document. This document details the roles you can take on. It also includes a guide to contributing and links to `good first issue`s where we're looking for help.

If you're interested in participating in the Community Committee directly, you're more than welcome to join via the Zoom link posted in our bi-weekly meeting issues.

## Strategic Initiatives

Initiatives are projects that the Community Committee and the broader community members are collaborating on to further the [PSF Mission](https://psfoundation.cash/biz-plan/business-plan#mission) across the ecosystem.

At any one time the PSF Community Committee has a number of strategic initiatives underway. With the less-tangible approach to the work that the Community Committee does, having a way to track this work is important.

For each strategic initiative, the Community Committee's goal is to have a single point of reference - a champion - that understands what's happening with the initiative to the fullest extent possible, and can report on the initiative as needed.

A review of the initiatives will be a standing item on the Community Committee agenda (even if the update is 'nothing new') as a way to ensure they are active and have the support needed.

## Meetings

Community Committee meetings are broadcast via Zoom. The join link is published in the meeting's respective issue. Meeting times are coordinated to optimize for contributor timezones.

Current meeting cadence is every other week on Thursdays.  Please check the [PSF Project calendar][calendar] for next scheduled meeting.  Also, the [issues][meeting-search] section of this repo will include a CommComm meeting issue, some time before it begins.

We stream our conference call straight to YouTube so anyone can listen to it live, it should start playing on the [PSF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ57IDXJJSYXHBLpF1tBD0g) when we turn it on. There's usually a short cat-herding time at the start of the meeting and then occasionally we have some quick private business to attend to before we can start recording and streaming. Please be patient, and it should show up.

## Governance and Current Members

The Community Committee is an autonomous committee that collaborates alongside the [TSC](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/TSC) and whose governance was strongly influenced by the TSC's example. See [governance documentation](./governance) to learn more about the group's evolving structure and [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidance about the expectations for all contributors to this project.
